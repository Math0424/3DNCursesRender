This is a small 3d rendering engine I made

Running the program:
   Run the command 'make' to create and build the program

   in the Makefile change the first argument under run to change
   the input files, there are a few included in the /models/ directory

   the file format is .obj, though only the obj's that blender creates by default
   all meshes are also triangulated meaning quads are not supported.
